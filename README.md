## Set up and running instructions

To install the necessary dependencies run the following the the main directory:
 
 ### `npm install`
 
 To run the app
 
 ### `npm start`



## Thought process:

These are the steps/thought process I went through when building this app:
 
 1. Figure out how to access the webcam
 2. Figure out how to get screenshots
 3. Googled "react webcam" and found the '[react-webcam](https://github.com/mozmorris/react-webcam)' component which included screenshots, awesome!
 4. Created react app using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
 5. Installed react-webcam
 6. Made a webcam component to manage the interval of screenshots taken, adding in react-webcam component
 7. Created a loop to display the screens.
 8. Got inspired by the constant selfies to create a photoshoot version(see branch 'sydneys_twist')
